# RACCAM HACKATHON 1.0 - AI/ML System for Detecting and Mitigating Online Fraud

## Problem Statement

**Design a Automated AI/ML System for Detecting and Mitigating Online Fraud**

Creating and implementing an AI/ML-based system that can autonomously analyze and categorize online content, distinguishing between authentic and fake/fraudulent websites, advertisements, and customer care numbers.

## Solution

### 1. Website Authentications
Developing algorithms to assess the legitimacy of websites based on domain names, SSL certificates, typos, and poor website design.

### 2. Ad Content Analysis
Implementing NLP and image recognition techniques to analyze the extracted content and images present in the advertisement, along with the URL incorporated, to evaluate the authenticity and accuracy of the ad content.

### 3. Customer Care Number Verification
Establishing a database of fake/scam customer care numbers and comparing incoming numbers through REST API to identify potential scams.

### 4. Real-time Detection
Enabling real-time analysis of online content using a Chrome extension to prevent users from accessing fake or malicious websites.

### 5. User Feedback Integration
Incorporating an HTML form for user feedback to enhance the extensionâ€™s accuracy and adapt to evolving fraudulent tactics.
