# Project Name

Design a Automated AI/ML System for Detecting and Mitigating Online Fraud

## Description

A web application for analyzing websites. It checks the legitimacy of the domain, validates SSL certificates, and uses machine learning to predict website legitimacy based on various features and the image content present on the websites.

## Features

- *Domain Legitimacy Check:* Analyzes the expiration date of the domain to determine its legitimacy.

- *SSL Certificate Validation:* Checks the validity of the SSL certificate associated with the analyzed website.

- *HTTPS Detection:* Determines whether the website uses HTTPS or HTTP.

- *Machine Learning Prediction:* Leverages 16 key features to predict various aspects of the analyzed website, providing insights into potential security risks and overall legitimacy.

- *Images Content Analysis:* Utilizing NLP and image recognition methods to assess the authenticity and accuracy of ad content and the images present on the website.

- *Customer care number database Creation:* Implementing web scraping to build a database of fraudulent customer care numbers and using a REST API to verify incoming numbers for potential scams.

- *Feedback Form:*  Feedback to enhance the extensionâ€™s accuracy and adapt to evolving fraudulent tactics.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web framework
- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) for machine learning predictions
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) for web scraping
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for HTML parsing
- Chromium-Chrome driver for automated browsing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heygauri/30f7f52d2f8f09918a279510ed00e6b5_CyberZen_05
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open the application in your web browser: http://localhost:5000/

Usage
Enter the URL of the website you want to analyze in the provided user interface.

Click the "Analyze" button.

Review the analysis results, including domain legitimacy, SSL information, HTTPS usage, and machine learning predictions.

## Limitations 
- Our process is currently time-consuming due to the utilization of the Image-to-Text machine learning model. We are exploring avenues to optimize this model, enhancing its efficiency and contributing to a faster and more streamlined website authenticity tracking system.

- The comprehensive scanning of all hyperlinks on the entire website is time-consuming, primarily due to resource limitations. While not every link has been checked yet, the extracted hyperlinks enable us to assess the presence of potential phishing URLs within legitimate websites.
