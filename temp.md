# Project Name

Design a Automated AI/ML System for Detecting and Mitigating Online Fraud

## Description

A web application for analyzing websites. It checks the legitimacy of the domain, validates SSL certificates, and uses machine learning to predict website legitimacy based on various features and the image content present on the websites.

## Features

- *Domain Legitimacy Check:* Analyzes the expiration date of the domain to determine its legitimacy.

- *SSL Certificate Validation:* Checks the validity of the SSL certificate associated with the analyzed website.

- *HTTPS Detection:* Determines whether the website uses HTTPS or HTTP.

- *Machine Learning Prediction:* Leverages 16 key features to predict various aspects of the analyzed website, providing insights into potential security risks and overall legitimacy.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web framework
- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) for machine learning predictions
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) for web scraping
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for HTML parsing
