        <h2 style="color: black;">Dos and Don'ts for Identifying Phishing URLs</h2>
        <p>In the digital age, where the internet plays a crucial role in our daily lives, it's essential to be
            vigilant and protect yourself from online frauds. One common cyber threat is phishing, where attackers attempt to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information through deceptive websites. To help you navigate the online landscape safely, here are some dos and don'ts for identifying phishing URLs.</p>
        
        <!-- Dos Section -->
        <h3>Dos:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Check the URL Carefully:</strong> Examine the URL in your browser's address bar. Legitimate
                websites usually have a secure connection (https://) and a recognizable domain name. Be mindful of even small changes made to the domain name.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for HTTPS:</strong> Ensure that the website uses HTTPS. The 'S' stands for secure,
                indicating that the connection is encrypted. Legitimate websites, especially those handling
                sensitive information, use HTTPS to protect your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Mindful of Social Media Sharing:</strong> Limit the personal information shared on social media platforms. Cybercriminals often use social engineering, gathering information from social media to tailor phishing attempts.</li>
            <li><strong>Regularly Update Passwords:</strong> Change your passwords periodically and use strong, unique combinations. Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts to minimize the impact of a potential breach.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regularly update your browser and security software. Updates
                often include patches for known vulnerabilities, making it harder for attackers to exploit
                weaknesses.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Security Software:</strong> Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software. These
                tools can help detect and block phishing attempts, providing an additional layer of protection.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Don'ts Section -->
        <h3>Don'ts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don't Click on Suspicious Links:</strong> Avoid clicking on links in emails, messages, or pop-ups
                from unknown or untrusted sources. Instead, navigate to the website directly by typing the URL in
                your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Ignore Browser Warnings:</strong> Pay attention to warning messages from your browser about
                potential security risks. Modern browsers often flag phishing websites, protecting you from potential
                threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Provide Personal Information:</strong> Never enter sensitive information, such as passwords or
                credit card details, on a website that seems suspicious. Legitimate websites use secure methods to
                handle such data.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Rely Solely on Email Content:</strong> Phishing attempts often involve fake emails that mimic
                trusted sources. Don't solely rely on the content of an email; independently verify the information
                provided.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Assume Legitimacy Based on Appearance:</strong> Phishing websites can replicate the look of
                legitimate sites. Don't assume a website is safe just because it looks professional. Always verify
                the URL and check for secure connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Share OTP :</strong> Never share your One-Time Password (OTP) or
                personal information, such as Aadhar, PAN ID, or other sensitive details, with anyone, especially
                through unsolicited messages or calls.</li>
            <li><strong>Beware of Fraud Techniques:</strong> Fraud can happen through various techniques, including
                phishing emails, fake websites, social engineering, phone calls, text messages and more. Be cautious and stay informed about
                emerging fraud tactics.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <p>By following these dos and don'ts, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing
            attacks. Stay informed, be cautious, and empower yourself to navigate the online world securely. If in
            doubt, trust your instincts and take the necessary precautions to protect your personal information.
        </p>

        <p>Remember: Your online safety is in your hands. Stay vigilant, stay secure!</p>
